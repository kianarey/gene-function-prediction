## Project Description
Discovering the function of genes is critical to determining the importance of a gene to cell function. A machine learning algorithm that could predict the Gene Ontology (GO) term associated with a given gene would be an extremely valuable tool for exploring different genes and their functions. Machine learning has a variety of algorithms for prediction; in this project, we explored the performance of some of these algorithms on GO term performance. Algorithms explored are the following: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Regularized Linear Regression (RLR), Random Forest (RF), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN). Algorithms are evaluated and compared using an area under the curve (AUC) score, averaged among 200 GO terms.

## Results
While we originally thought kNN would perform the worst as a model, our cross validation and Kaggle scores proved this not to be the case. In its simplicity, the kNN model outperformed other models we tested.
